CasSTGCN
==== 
CasSTGCN:Cascade Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Information Cascade Prediction  

A novel deep learning model based on an encoder-decoder architecture. encoder employs multiple Spatio-Temporal  
Graph Convolutional (ST-GCN) modules, and the decoder further leverages Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)  
to extract multi-scale temporal features for accurate prediction
